* migration from impermanence works fine, but needs some specific documentation

* add support for tmpfiles' modifiers?

* custom systemd-tmpfiles service in stage-2?

  Currently the two upstream services are used, one in initrd to prepare
  files before switch-root, and the second one in stage-2 after switch-root.

  Right now there is no way to provision files with the same systemd-tmpfiles
  configuration inside a  directory structure that is also persisted by
  Preservation, unless the preservation happens in stage-1 and the rest
  in stage-2. This is because Preservation uses systemd-tmpfiles to create
  files and directories before creating the corresponding bindmounts between them.

  Another issue occurs with the systemd-journald-flush.service, which is ordered
  to run before tmpfiles-setup, while having a dependency on var-log.mount.
  Should /var/log be persisted with Preservation, the var-log.mount unit
  will be generated by Preservation as a bindmount from the volatile to
  the persistent volume and because the underlying directories need to
  exist before the mount is created, var-log.mount will be ordered after
  systemd-tmpfiles-setup, thus causing a dependency loop.

  At this moment a simple solution to this problem is to configure the
  preservation of /var/log with `inInitrd = true` so that everything is
  already set up in stage-1, which avoids the dependency loop in stage-2
  altogether.

  One alternative to this would be to create a custom systemd-tmpfiles
  service specifically for Preservation, that is ordered before the
  default systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service. To make this feasible, it
  would be nice to have access to the upstream NixOS option definitions
  for `systemd.tmpfiles.settings` via the systemd-lib.
